      <h5>Encryption</h5>

        <p>
         Encryption, and more specifically, End-to-End Encryption (E2EE), has reached buzzword status in the collaborative communication industry, and there have been many questions about what E2EE does and, perhaps more importantly, doesn’t mean for an enterprise collaboration system. 
          <br>
          <br>
          To address these, we should first consider which problems encryption solves. Then we will examine how to construct a global threat reduction strategy for those problems and discuss where E2EE fits into such a framework.

          Why Encryption?
          <br>
          <br>
          This seems like a simple question, but most people, if pressed, cannot readily answer it. In point of fact, encryption addresses Confidentiality and Integrity, two of the main cornerstones of the governing principles of modern data security (the other being Availability, collectively forming the so-called C-I-A Triad).
          Data Encryption Processes
          <br>
          <br>
        There are three main categories or states of data that can exist in or between systems.<br><br>
          1. Data-in-Transit (DIT), also known as data-in-motion, refers to the state of data being transferred from one system to another. When you are using a secured browser or VPN to transfer data, that is encrypted DIT.<br><br>
          2. Data-at-Rest (DAR) refers to the state of data stored within a system, either temporarily or long-term. A database with encrypted passwords protects DAR.<br><br>
          3. Data-in-Process (DIP), also known as data-in-use, refers to the momentary state of data as system processors manipulate and act on data. DIP is distinct from DAR and DIT in that it must act on physical memory. Intel’s Total Memory Encryption (TME) and AMD’s Secure Memory Encryption (SME) are examples of encrypted DIP.<br><br>

        What does backup data mean?
        <br><br>
        Typically backup data means all necessary data for the workloads your server is running. This can include documents, media files, configuration files, machine images, operating systems, and registry files. Essentially, any data that you want to preserve can be stored as backup data.
        <br><br>
        Data backup includes several important concepts:
        <br><br>
        Backup solutions and tools—while it is possible to back up data manually, to ensure systems are backed up regularly and consistently, most organizations use a technology solution to back up their data.
        <br><br>
        Backup administrator: <br><br>every organization should designate an employee responsible for backups. That employee should ensure backup systems are set up correctly, test them periodically and ensure that critical data is actually backed up.
        <br><br>
        Backup scope and schedule:<br><br>an organization must decide on a backup policy, specifying which files and systems are important enough to be backed up, and how frequently data should be backed up.
        <br><br>
        Recovery Point Objective (RPO):<br><br>RPO is the amount of data an organization is willing to lose if a disaster occurs, and is determined by the frequency of backup. If systems are backed up once per day, the RPO is 24 hours. The lower the RPO, the more data storage, compute and network resources are required to achieve frequent backups.
        <br><br>
        Recovery Time Objective (RTO):<br><br>RTO is the time it takes for an organization to restore data or systems from backup and resume normal operations. For large data volumes and/or backups stored off-premises, copying data and restoring systems can take time, and robust technical solutions are needed to ensure a low RTO.</p>
